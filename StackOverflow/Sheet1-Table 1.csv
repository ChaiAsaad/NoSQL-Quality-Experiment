CAP theorem - Availability and Partition Tolerance;"Considering P in equal terms with C and A is a bit of a mistake, rather '2 out of 3' notion among C,A,P is misleading. The succinct way I would explain CAP theorem is, ""In a distributed data store, at the time of network partition you have to chose either Consistency or Availability and cannot get both"". Newer NoSQL systems are trying to focus on Availability while traditional ACID databases had a higher focus on Consistency.";;;67

Possibility of duplicate Mongo ObjectId's being generated in two different collections?;ObjectIds are generated client-side in a manner similar to UUID but with some nicer properties for storage in a database such as roughly increasing order and encoding their creation time for free. The key thing for your use case is that they are designed to guarantee uniqueness to a high probability even if they are generated on different machines.;;;16

When should I use a NoSQL database instead of a relational database? Is it okay to use both on the same site?;NoSQL solutions are usually meant to solve a problem that relational databases are either not well suited for, too expensive to use (like Oracle) or require you to implement something that breaks the relational nature of your db anyway.;AsafAsaf;            6,05611 gold badge2020 silver badges4444 bronze badges;81

Where does mongodb stand in the CAP theorem?;I agree with Luccas post. You can't just say that MongoDB is CP/AP/CA, because it actually is a trade-off between C, A and P, depending on both database/driver configuration and type of disaster: here's a visual recap, and below a more detailed explanation.;JoCaJoCa;            83588 silver badges1313 bronze badges;62

How do you track record relations in NoSQL?;The couchDB approach suggest to emit proper classes of stuff in map phase and summarize it in reduce.. So you could map all comments and emit 1 for the given user and later print out only ones. It would require however lots of disk storage to build persistent views of all trackable data in couchDB. btw they have also this wiki page about relationships: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/EntityRelationship.;user425720user425720;            3,55011 gold badge1919 silver badges2323 bronze badges;4

SQL (MySQL) vs NoSQL (CouchDB) [closed];Seems like only real solutions today revolve around scaling out or sharding. All modern databases (NoSQLs as well as NewSQLs) support horizontal scaling right out of the box, at the database layer, without the need for the application to have sharding code or something.;;;4

MongoDB dot (.) in key name;As mentioned in other answers MongoDB does not allow $ or . characters as map keys due to restrictions on field names. However, as mentioned in Dollar Sign Operator Escaping this restriction does not prevent you from inserting documents with such keys, it just prevents you from updating or querying them.;Steve EynonSteve Eynon;            4,53011 gold badge2626 silver badges4545 bronze badges;26
How does column-oriented NoSQL differ from document-oriented?;"In Cassandra, each row (addressed by a key) contains one or more ""columns"". Columns are themselves key-value pairs. The column names need not be predefined, i.e. the structure isn't fixed. Columns in a row are stored in sorted order according to their keys (names).";DNADNA;            40.8k1212 gold badges9999 silver badges139139 bronze badges;43
NoSql Crash Course/Tutorial [closed];Here is a decent slide show introducing MongoDB. I think some of the big differences is that most of the systems rely on Active Record or some similar database abstraction.;;;45

How to Add a Column in DynamoDB;"Well, let's not get dragged away in the semantic discussion about the difference between ""fields"" and ""columns"". The word ""column"" does remind us of relational databases, which dynamodb is not. In essence that means that dynamodb does not have foreign keys.";;;11
Best data store for billions of rows;Contrary to popular belief, NoSQL is not about performance, or even scalability.  It's mainly about minimizing the so-called Object-Relational impedance mismatch, but is also about horizontal scalability vs. the more typical vertical scalability of an RDBMS.;;;17
SQL versus noSQL (speed);"The definition of noSQL systems is a very broad one -- a database that doesn't use SQL / is not a RDBMS.
Therefore, the answer to your question is, in short: ""it depends"".";CarstenCarsten;            17.1k33 gold badges4444 silver badges5252 bronze badges;61
Large scale data processing Hbase vs Cassandra [closed];Trying to determine which is best for you really depends on what you are going to use it for, they each have their advantages and without any more details it becomes more of a religious war. That post you referenced is also more than a year old and both have gone through many changes since then. Please also keep in mind I am not familiar with the more recent Cassandra developments.;cftarnascftarnas;            1,7351010 silver badges99 bronze badges;91
Differences between OT and CRDT;;;;
Can I do transactions and locks in CouchDB?;Expanding on MrKurt's answer. For lots of scenarios you don't need to have stock tickets redeemed in order.  Instead of selecting the first ticket, you can select randomly from the remaining tickets. Given a large number tickets and a large number of concurrent requests, you will get much reduced contention on those tickets, versus everyone trying to get the first ticket.;;;27

How reliable is ElasticSearch as a primary datastore against factors like write loss, data availability;It is generally a good idea to design redundant data storage solutions. For example, it could be a fast and reliable approach to first just push everything as flat data to a static storage like s3 then have ES pull and index data from there. If you need more flexibility leveraging some ORM, you could have an RDS or Redshift layer in between. This way the data can always be rebuilt in ES.;;;12

3 fields composite primary key (unique item) in Dynamodb;I believe the first option offered by @georgeaf99 won't work, because if you do it that way, then CompanyCode has to be unique in the table.

The Next-gen Databases [closed];I'm missing graph databases in the answers so far. A graph or network of objects is common in programming and can be useful in databases as well. It can handle semi-structured and interconnected information in an efficient way. Among the areas where graph databases have gained a lot of interest are semantic web and bioinformatics. RDF was mentioned, and it is in fact a language that represents a graph. Here's some pointers to what's happening in the graph database area:;nawrothnawroth;            4,33111 gold badge2222 silver badges2121 bronze badges;25

Namespaces in Redis?;If you are using Node, ioredis has transparent key prefixing, which works by having the client prepend a given string to each key in a command. It works in the same way that Ruby's redis-namespace does. This client-side approach still puts all your keys into the same database, but at least you add some structure, and you don't have to use multiple databases or servers.;;;4
What are the differences between a node, a cluster and a datacenter in a cassandra nosql database?;"A node is a single machine that runs Cassandra.

Any detailed and specific reasons for Why MongoDB is much faster than SQL DBs?;"In general, MySQL and MongoDB are quite similar in ""durable"" write performance on a single machine. Simple key/value lookups are almost the same... if you want to use MySQL that way. Document support is, obviously, a big productivity benefit and a big win for performance.";;;5
What does 'soft-state' in BASE mean?;"I was taught in classes that ""Soft state"" means that the state of the system could change over time (even during times without input), because there may be changes going on due to ""eventual consistency"". That's why says ""soft"" state.";;;7

Can relational database scale horizontally;I think the answer is, unequivocally, yes. You have to keep in mind that SQL is simply a data access language. There is absolutely no reason why it can't be extended across multiple computers and network partitions. Is it a challenging problem? Most certainly, and that's why software that does it is in its infancy.;;;26

How to load 100 million records into MongoDB with Scala for performance testing?;I've had the same thing.  As far as I can tell, it comes down to the randomness of the index values.

Because you're inserting random, as opposed to sequential, values into these indexes, you're constantly accessing the entire index to find where to place the new value.;;;6

How to choose between Cassandra, Membase, Hadoop, MongoDB, RDBMS etc.? [closed];;;;
NoSQL and spatial data;"Currently, MongoDB uses geohashing with B-trees which will be slower than the R-trees of PostGIS (I can't give exact numbers, I'm afraid, but there is plenty of theoretical literature on the differences). However, in these slides, http://www.slideshare.net/nknize/rtree-spatial-indexing-with-mongodb-mongodc the author talks about adding R-trees to MongoDB and sharding on a geo key. You talk about desktop use, so geosharding may not be of interest, as sharding's benefits will be felt more on massive datasets.
Ultimately, it probably comes down more to what you want to do with your spatial data. Postgis has vastly more functions and support for topology, rasters, 3D, conversions between coordinate systems, so if this is what you are looking for, PostGIS would still be the best option. If you are interested in storing billions/trillions of spatial objects and just running basic find all points near/inside this point based on some criteria, then MongoDB is likely a very good choice.";;;6

Are there any REAL advantages to NoSQL over RDBMS for structured data on one machine?;Schema-less storage (or schema-free). Ability to modify the storage (basically add new fields to records) without having to modify the storage 'declared' schema. RDBMSs require the explicit declaration of said 'fields' and require explicit modifications to the schema before a new 'field' is saved. A schema-free storage engine allows for fast application changes, just modify the app code to save the extra fields, or rename the fields, or drop fields and be done.;;;2

For your usecase, it would be better to redesign your table to use Range Keys.

NoSQL vs. SQL when scalability is irrelevant;"There are a lot of other conditions that I've been hearing about with non-relational systems vs relational. I prefer this terminology over sql/no-sql as I personally think it describes the differences better, and several of the ""no-sql"" servers have sql add-ons, so anyway.... what sort of concurrency pattern or tranaction isolation is required in your system. One of the purported differences between rel and non-rel dbs is the ""consistent-always"", ""consistent-mostly"" or ""consistent-eventually"". Relation dbs by default usually fall into the ""consistent-mostly"" category and with some work, and a whole lot of locking and race conditions, ;) can be ""consistent-always"" so everyone is always looking at the most correct representation of a given piece of data. Most of what I've read/heard about non-rel dbs is that they are mainly ""consistent-eventually"". By this it means that there may be many instances of our data floating around, so user ""A"" may see that we have 92 widgets in inventory, whereas user ""B"" may see 79, and they may not get reconciled until someone actually goes to pull stuff from the warehouse. Another issue is mutability of data, how often does it need to be updated?

Tag each item with all the categories in it's path, so ""Sport > Baseball > Shoes"" could be saved as {..., categories: [""sport"", ""baseball"", ""shoes""], ...}. If you want all items in the ""Sport"" category, search for {categories: ""sport""}, if you want just the shoes, search for {tags: ""shoes""}.";;;4

Why are RDBMS considered Available (CA) for CAP Theorem;I believe you are misunderstanding the relation between CAP-Availability and node-UP/DOWN. Availability is about providing an answer to every received query - when a node is down it cannot receive queries, therefore if you bring down parts of or the entire cluster, the CAP-Availability property holds. Although this may sound counter intuitive at first glance, by shutting down nodes you are holding on to CAP-Availability and dropping CAP-Partition tolerance instead. I've recently posted an answer whose examples provide some clarification.;João MatosJoão Matos;            4,19344 gold badges2929 silver badges5959 bronze badges;1

Which NoSQL DB is best fitted for OLTP financial systems?;One has to think about the problem differently.

What are good NoSQL and non-relational database solutions for audit/logging database;Yes, you should!  If you just want to store stuff and scan it, you might as well write to a file.  Very fast, no overhead!

Do graph databases deprecate relational databases?;"Building on Erwin Smout's fine answer, an important reason why the relational model supplanted the graph one is that a graph has a greater degree of ""bias"" baked into its structure than relations do. The edges of a graph are navigational links which user queries are expected to traverse in a particular way. A relational model of the same data assumes much less about how the data will be used. Users are free to join and manipulate relational data in ways that the database designer might not have foreseen. The disruptive costs of re-engineering graph database structures to support new requirements were a factor which drove the adoption of the relational model and its SQL-based offshoots in the 1980s.";;;16

mongodb not using indexes when sorting?;It is using an index -- the index on msgid. MongoDB chooses an index to use for a query by trying all possible indexes, and using whichever one finishes first.

Distributed NoSQL database for Raspberry Pi with sharding and replication?;I don't have my Raspberry Pi yet, but I am really hoping that Redis runs on a Raspberry Pi.  From looking around the Redis website, there's no reason to believe it shouldn't.;;;4
why is scaling writes to a relational database virtually impossible?;A sharded database is actually quite different to a normal SQL database. In a lot of ways it is more like a custom NoSQL system that just happens to use a database for storage. Unless your dataset consists of a lot of completely disconnected subsets, most queries more complex than get by ID won't work the same as they do on a single node database.;;;6

How does mongoDB actually work? [duplicate];The reason why you are having trouble wrapping your head around it is because MongoDB is not a relational database, it is a document-oriented database.  For something simple like a tree of comments with a very set structure and a one-to-many relationship you would probably be best off sticking with MySQL.  User profile might be an interesting thing to use MongoDB for, but again, if it is very structured you might be better off with MySQL.;tplanertplaner;            8,14533 gold badges2828 silver badges4747 bronze badges;6
Redis periodically stops responding on high load;We found if you use aof persistance along with rdb snapshots, sometimes the rdb updating can delay the aof being updated, which in turn causes writes to redis to block. Turning off aof persistance cured the intermittant latency we were having, which was ok for us as loosing the latest few keys due to a crash was not to important.;;;2

What NoSQL database (categories) support versioning?;A really interesting approach to this is the Datomic database. Rather store versions, in Datomic, there are no updates only inserts. The entire database is immutable meaning you can specify the moment of truth you want to see the database as on connect and the entire history will appear to only contain the changes made up to that point. Or to think of it another any anything inserted into the database can be queried for its history looking backward. You can also branch the database and create data in one branch that isn't in the other (in programming it is like a database based on git, where multiple histories can be created);;;5

Hybrid DB System: NoSQL for data, SQL for relationships. Best Practice? [closed];If the only reason you like to use a NoSQL database along with a RDBMS is to gain speed and flexibility, I'd suggest to use a caching server instead (such as Memcache). You could build a document/result using sql statements and store it using a single key value in memcache for retrieving it later. Its much easier to implement than say MongoDB. But it of course depends on your requirements if you really only intend to do document lookups by using a key or plan to use more complex queries for your documents.;;;5

Titan vertex centric indices vs Neo4j labels;"Agreeing with everything Marko said, one could take it further and argue that in the graph database world local indexes can (and even should) substitute global ones.

With this in mind, I'd argue that labels in Neo4j actually detract from all this; reifying a label into a node with adjacent edges pointing to the source having that label is much more in line with the ""schema is the graph"" philosophy.";;;11

How does Cassandra scale horizontally ?;The number of replicas (i.e. the identical data) you want to store for each partition (row/piece of data) is configurable.  So, if you have n nodes, you could in theory set the database to replicate each partition n times.  Then, horizontal scaling would not occur if you add more nodes.  However, if you set the number of replicas to 1 or 2, you have more space per node to store data horizontally.  New data can then go into new nodes.  Keep in mind though, that with less replicas you have a greater chance of losing data if any set of nodes go down at a particular time.;;;2

it recursively moves up the tablet location hierarchy.
If the client's cache is empty, the location algorithm
requires three network round-trips, including one read
from Chubby. If the client's cache is stale, the location
algorithm could take up to six round-trips, because stale
cache entries are only discovered upon misses (assuming
that METADATA tablets do not move very frequently).
Although tablet locations are stored in memory, so no
GFS accesses are required, we further reduce this cost
in the common case by having the client library prefetch
tablet locations: it reads the metadata for more than one
tablet whenever it reads the METADATA table.""";;;1

Which NoSQL storage to choose;At one level document and key/value are quite similar - both will return an object when you request a key. In pure key/value that object will be a simple string, although it can be a serialized complex object. A document database extends this with functions to work with this object such as partial update functionality or search indexing.;;;2

How does HBase guarantee row level atomicity?;HBase currently achieves row-level atomicity in spite of writing multiple HFiles by flushing all column families at the same time. The flush is triggered when the biggest column family reaches the configured flush size. There is an additional MemStore-level timestamp that allows to do multi-version concurrency control for MemStore reads, but that does not exist for key/values that are written to HFiles. Switching to per-column-family flush (a desirable feature for improving efficiency) would require a similar timestamp to be added to the file format as well.;;;1

Best NoSQL approach to handle 100+ million records;It really depends on your data sets. The number one rule to NoSQL design is to define your query scenarios first. Once you really understand how you want to query the data then you can look into the various NoSQL solutions out there. The default unit of distribution is key. Therefore you need to remember that you need to be able to split your data between your node machines effectively otherwise you will end up with a horizontally scalable system with all the work still being done on one node (albeit better queries depending on the case).;;;3

There is a compelling argument for it being a K/V store, also, but I'd say for the purposes of communicating differences in competing NoSQL solutions in an educational course, categorising it as a document store wouldn't be unreasonable.;;;2

Combining noSQL and ORM in an MVC framework for a real-case application;It's not really beneficial to drop the ORM entirely. But you may have to rewrite it quite a bit. There are lots of little things like transactions, evented sequential writes, error handling, and data integrity checks that an ORM could handle for you in a noSQL fashion.;;;1
Is it possible to use RDF storage also as a document-oriented database?;The closest thing you can use in RDF databases are named graphs. In a named graph, you can put a set of RDF triples. This set of triples can be asserted from one or many RDF documents depending on your needs. Lets say you want one named graph per RDF document. You could name the graph with a URI that reflects the file location a URL or a IRI.

Serializiation with Protocol Buffers in a schemaless Database;You may want to look into something like Cassandra or HBase for storing your data.  The issue with the opaque data blob is that you can't query based on it with your MySQL schema here.  If you're looking for something, you'll have to read in every blob and check it.  If that's really unimportant to how you're doing lookups (i.e. you always the the key), then I would suggest using protocol buffers to serialize the data, possibly compressing with zlib or LZO compression.;Joshua MartellJoshua Martell;            7,06322 gold badges2929 silver badges3737 bronze badges;1

Depends how many clients finally you'd like to have (e.g. are we talking about hundreds or thousands?), how many tables are in each keyspaces, and how they are used.

What are some real use cases for going with a NoSQL Document Store db?;"Use Case
We use MongoDB for a large scale extremely transient data structure.
It in effect works as a job tracker / manager with many work units being processed every second.
The work unit has no defined schema (different units are invented somewhat frequently) yet we need to have the ability to query for specific fields or properties without iterating over the entire DB.
So to recap:
highly transient, highly available (can't afford to block for a query) with a work load of approximately 600QPS for a single ""commodity"" machine running in the cloud.";;;8
DynamoDB adjacency list primary key;I don't think you are missing anything. The idea is that ID is unique for the type of item.

cassandra:: can i create a table without a primarykey?;Cassandra is not a relational DB. Using indexes in the way you're intended to use indexes does not work well in Cassandra. The primary reason this is true is that Cassandra is designed for a use case where you have dozens, hundreds, or thousands of servers in a cluster - it uses the first part of the primary key (the partition key) to determine which servers own that data. Cassandra's secondary indexes (which you mention wanting to use) are node-local - to use those, Cassandra would have to ask every server in the cluster for the query, multiplying the impact of the query by every node in the cluster.;;;4

NoSQL DataBases [closed];NoSQL systems such as MongoDB are those which are designed for incredibly data-intensive applications - Facebook for example created a NoSQL solution called Cassandra to handle the vast amounts of data they had. NoSQL is useful for those who are building highly scalable applications and helps to reduce the need for empty table columns by not enforcing a database schema, so for instance if you had a table in which you stored information about your friends, you wouldn't have to include the reading interests of one where you knew the reading interests of the other.;;;3

It has some features beyond Voldemort (Order-Preserving Partitioner which allows range queries; BigTable style structure for values); and is missing others (no alternate storage backends or version clocks for versioning).
Its performance is more optimal for fast writes, but its biggest strength is probably ease at which it can be horizontally scaled by adding new nodes (something where V is bit more static).";;;3
Are there ORM (OKM) for key-value stores?;One of the design goals of SQL is that any data can be stored/queried in any relational database - There are some differences between platforms, but in general the correct way to handle a particular data structure is well known and easily automated but requiring fairly verbose code. That is not the case with NoSQL - generally you will be directly storing the data as used in your application rather than trying to map it to a relational structure, and without joins or other object/relational differences the mapping code is trivial.;;;4
